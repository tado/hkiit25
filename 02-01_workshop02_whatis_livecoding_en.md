## Live coding

This time, we will focus on the "live" aspect
and use the term **Live coding**

First, let's consider the meaning of "live"

# Live - Coding as a Live Performance

## Live - Coding as a Live Performance

- Another meaning of "live"

- Various attempts have been made in live music performance
- "Live electronic music"

**However, there was a problem...**
What are they actually doing? Are they really performing?

## TOPLAP Manifesto

http://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft

- Give us access to the performer's mind, to the whole human instrument.
- Obscurantism is dangerous. **Show us your screens.**
- Programs are instruments that can change themselves
- The program is to be transcended - Artificial language is the way.
- Code should be seen as well as heard, underlying algorithms viewed as well as their visual outcome.
- Live coding is not about tools. Algorithms are thoughts. Chainsaws are tools. That's why algorithms are sometimes harder to notice than chainsaws.

### Now, let's start live coding!
