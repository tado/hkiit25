## Lecture overview

---

In this course, we will broadly learn the fundamentals and applications of generative AI and explore the possibilities of AI in creative practice. We begin by understanding what AI is, including basic concepts such as neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning. We will then experience how AI can be leveraged in creation through practical examples such as programming assistance tools and generation of text, images, music, and video. While exploring how automation and generative technologies can transform the fields of art and design, we will also critically examine their limitations and challenges. Ultimately, each participant will plan and present a creative project using generative AI, and through its outcomes, envision the future possibilities of creative practice.

### Syllabus introduction

The technological progress of AI is remarkable and has a huge impact on the world. In creative fields such as art and design, it has become something we can no longer ignore. This course explores the fundamentals and applications of artificial intelligence—especially generative AI—and examines the process of creating creative works using AI. We will first learn the basics of AI, such as neural networks and machine learning, using tools like Google Teachable Machine. We will then delve into AI-powered creation including programming assistance, text and image generation, music, interactive media generation, and video generation. Based on what we have learned, we will conduct a midterm presentation, after which each participant will plan a creative project using generative AI. Participants will present their projects, engage in discussion, and proceed to produce the final project. In the end, we will plan an exhibition of the works and hold a critique session.

## Question - Is it okay to use generative AI?

---

In the course "Artificial Intelligence and Creation," we will actively use AI technologies, especially generative AI. First, I will explain the stance on generative AI in this course.

Note: These opinions are those of the instructor (Tadokoro) of this class only. For other classes or workshops, please follow the instructions of the respective instructors regarding whether to use generative AI.


---

The advent of generative AI is very similar to the time about 30 years ago when search engine services on the Internet began

  - Yahoo! (1994), Infoseek (1996), Google (2000)
  - It enabled things previously unimaginable
  - A wealth of knowledge became publicly available
  - Overturned conventional wisdom about studying, research, and inquiry
- When search services started, many people opposed them
  - Ethical perspective: "Online search is cheating," "Copy-paste reports"
  - Learning efficiency perspective: "Looking things up online isn't real learning"
  - Copyright perspective: "Collecting information without permission"
- Some even said "The government should regulate it!"

---

What happened now?

- Web search is too powerful and convenient
- Humanity can no longer return to the previous society
- While problems remain, the direction is to use it actively
- Not being able to use search is now the bigger problem

---

Generative AI holds even greater potential than search

- From "search" to "consultation"
- Can create (generate) new things from massive data
- Supports multiple media (text, images, music, video, programs)
- Anyone can immediately "stand on the shoulders of giants"

---

But there are issues…

- Content may contain falsehoods
→ Hallucinations
- Information leakage — it's dangerous to casually send confidential or personal information to ChatGPT
- Copyright infringement concerns
- Social impact (education and research)
- Some believe "generative AI is cheating"

---

"Perhaps humanity has already crossed the Rubicon in the past few months."
https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/docs/20230403-generative-ai

- It's important to act to find ways to avoid causing problems
- Actively explore potential uses

---

It's certain that generative AI will become impossible to ignore in creative fields like art and design

- In "Artificial Intelligence and Creation" we want to face generative AI head-on
- It's still a very new field
  - We'll try various things through trial and error…
  - What we do this year may already be outdated next year
  - High potential to create new works no one has made before
