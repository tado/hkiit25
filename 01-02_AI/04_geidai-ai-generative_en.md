# Artificial Intelligence and Creation<br>Critique: "AI-generated Self-Portrait"<br>History and Future of Generative Art

Tokyo University of the Arts Arts and Media Center
Atsushi Tadokoro

---

### Today's topics

In this session of "Artificial Intelligence and Creation," we'll begin with a critique of the assignment "AI-generated Self-Portrait." We'll review and discuss your generated self-portraits submitted via the online form. In the second half, as hints for understanding image generation by AI, we'll look back at the history of Generative Art from before today's AI to the present, and consider prospects for the future.

## Today's theme: History and Future of Generative Art

Today, under the theme "History and Future of Generative Art," we'll introduce many topics that could inspire your future works with generative AI!

### “Amid the A.I. Deluge, What Counts as Art? Ask the Curators.”

![height:540](https://i0.wp.com/yoppa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/19sp-finearts-AI-01-kvzt-superJumbo.jpg?w=2048&ssl=1)

[Amid the A.I. Deluge, What Counts as Art? Ask the Curators.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/arts/design/artificial-intelligence-art-museums.html)
 – The New York Times, October 18, 2025.

---

A quick summary…

**Curators' perspective** Many curators see the value of AI art not in technological novelty or visual appeal, but in the artist's "intent" and "process" behind it. A MoMA curator says, "Technology is not art in itself; ultimately individual creativity and vision matter." Works where artists deeply engage in building models and curating data are especially appreciated.

---

**Museum responses** Institutions are split. Some, like MoMA, are actively embracing AI art; artist Refik Anadol is also planning "Dataland," a museum dedicated to AI art in Los Angeles. Others, mindful of the cooling of the NFT boom, are taking a wait-and-see approach.

---

**Outlook** The current confusion about AI art resembles reactions to the emergence of cubism. After the initial hype settles, criteria will be established and audiences will develop their own critical lenses, the article concludes.

---

## Generative AI and Generative Art

---

The past decade has seen remarkable advances in Generative AI. But to reach today's systems, there's a long history of "Generative Art." Generative art broadly refers to art where works are autonomously produced using algorithms or systems. Rather than directly crafting the final piece, artists define the "rules" and "processes" by which works are generated. Generative AI can be considered the latest form of such generative art. Understanding its history provides clues to the possibilities, limits, and future outlook of generative AI.
