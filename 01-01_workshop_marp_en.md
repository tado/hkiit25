| **Day5** | Afternoon | Workshop 9 "Live Performance Production (Structure, Ideation)"<br>+ Preparation (Hands-on) |

---

### Significance of Audiovisual Integration
- Synergistic effects through interaction between sound and video
- Data-driven visual generation
- Creation of immersion in live performances

---

## Objective 3: Goals

✅ Master TouchDesigner basic operations and create simple visual works

✅ Analyze audio signals and map them to visual parameters

✅ Build an integrated system linking TidalCycles and TouchDesigner

---

## Objective 4: Technology Integration and Live Performance

### Final Goal
**Don't let the learned technologies end as fragmented knowledge**

Integrate Generative AI + Live Coding + Audiovisual to build **original live performances**

### Importance of an Integrated Approach
- Modern media art is interdisciplinary
- Not just acquiring individual technologies, but "design skills" to combine them are necessary
- Balance of technical implementation ability and artistic expression

---

## Components of Live Performance

1. **Concept** - Theme and message of the work
2. **Sound** - Music part using TidalCycles
3. **Visual** - Video part using TouchDesigner
4. **Interaction** - Integration of sound and video
5. **Direction** - Timing, development, climax

### Preparation for Presentation (Day 5 Afternoon - Day 6)
- Concept planning individually or in groups
- Prototype creation and testing
- Rehearsal and polishing

---

## Objective 4: Goals

✅ Design and implement works integrating multiple technologies

✅ Project management ability to complete works within limited time

✅ Communication ability to present your work to others
