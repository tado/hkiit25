### 1-2. Workshop Objectives (15 minutes)

This workshop aims not just to "use" digital technologies, but to master them as "tools of expression." Through 6 days of intensive learning, you will acquire practical skills to expand your creativity.

The specific objectives are the following four points:

* **1. Understanding Generative AI and Acquiring Creative Application Skills**
    * First, we will learn the fundamentals of generative AI, which has become essential in modern creative environments.
    * We will understand the concepts of core technologies such as Transformer and LLM, and learn how they are applied to image, music, and code generation.
    * Rather than just introducing tools, we will explore how to incorporate AI as a "source of ideas" or "collaborator" into your own creative process.
    * **Specific Learning Content:**
        * Fundamentals of prompt engineering - techniques for obtaining desired outputs from AI
        * Principles and utilization of image generation AI (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc.)
        * Idea development using text generation AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
        * Possibilities and limitations of music generation AI (Suno, Udio, etc.)
        * Critical consideration of the impact AI brings to the creative process
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Technically understand how generative AI works
        * Select and utilize appropriate AI tools for your own projects
        * Build new creative styles through collaboration between AI and humans

    * **Learning Flow:**
        * **Day 1 AM:** Opening Session (Orientation, Icebreaker)
        * **Day 1 PM:** Workshop 1 "The Future of Generative AI and Creation"

* **2. Acquiring Music Construction Skills through Live Coding**
    * We will thoroughly learn "live coding" technology from the basics, which generates music in real-time using code with TidalCycles.
    * You will experience composition and performance methods based on algorithmic thinking, different from traditional DAWs (music production software).
    * You will acquire skills to improvise pattern rearrangement, build complex rhythms, and develop the ability to express musical thinking in code.
    * **Characteristics of Live Coding:**
        * Generate and modify music in real-time while writing code
        * Concisely express complex polyrhythms through pattern-based composition methods
        * Balance of improvisation and reproducibility - the same code produces the same results
        * Collaborative development through open-source communities
    * **Learning Flow:**
        * **Day 2 AM:** Generative AI Creative Workshop Presentation + Workshop 2 "TidalCycles Installation Party"
        * **Day 2 PM:** Workshop 3 "What is Live Coding? TidalCycles Basic Tutorial" + Rhythm Pattern Creation (Hands-on)
        * **Day 3 AM:** TidalCycles Basic Tutorial Presentation + Workshop 4 "TidalCycles Practical Tutorial 1 (Chords/Scales, Complex Rhythms)"
        * **Day 3 PM:** Workshop 5 "TidalCycles Practical Tutorial 2 (Extensions)" + Mini Performance (Hands-on)
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Master TidalCycles basic syntax and freely write patterns
        * Build music using complex rhythm patterns and effects
        * Think in a way that connects music theory and coding
        * Acquire basic skills for improvisational live performances

* **3. Exploring Real-time Audiovisual Expression**
    * We will learn to operate TouchDesigner, a visual programming environment.
    * You will acquire techniques to generate interactive video in real-time.
    * In the latter half of the workshop, we will challenge creating audiovisual works where sound and video are closely linked by sending "sound" information (waveforms, frequency, rhythm) generated by TidalCycles to TouchDesigner.
    * **TouchDesigner Characteristics:**
        * Node-based visual programming environment
        * Excellent real-time performance, optimal for live performances
        * Integrated handling of 3D, 2D, audio, video, and data processing
        * Wide range of applications including projection mapping, VJing, installations, etc.
    * **Learning Content:**
        * **Day 4 AM:** Workshop 6 "TouchDesigner Installation and Introduction"
        * **Day 4 PM:** Workshop 7 "TouchDesigner Basic to Intermediate Tutorial" (Forming live performance teams)
        * **Day 5 AM:** TouchDesigner Tutorial Presentation + Workshop 8 "Audiovisual (Waveform/Spectrum Visualization, TidalCycles Integration)"
        * **Day 5 PM:** Workshop 9 "Live Performance Production (Structuring, Brainstorming)" + Preparation (Hands-on)
    * **Significance of Audiovisual Integration:**
        * Synergistic effects through the interaction of sound and video
        * Data-driven visual generation - musical information controls visual parameters
        * Creating immersive experiences in live performances
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Master basic TouchDesigner operations and create simple visual works
        * Analyze audio signals and map them to visual parameters
        * Build an integrated system linking TidalCycles and TouchDesigner

* **4. Technology Integration and Live Performance Practice**
    * The ultimate goal of this workshop is not to let the learned techniques end as fragmented knowledge.
    * You will integrate the elements of generative AI, live coding, and audiovisuals, and build your own original live performance.
    * Through the final day's presentation, you will practically develop the ability to shape ideas and communicate them to others.
    * **Importance of an Integrated Approach:**
        * Modern media art is interdisciplinary - fusion of music, video, programming, and design
        * Not just individual skill acquisition, but "design capability" to combine them is necessary
        * Balance of technical implementation and artistic expression
    * **Live Performance Components:**
        * **Concept:** Theme, message, what you want to express
        * **Sound:** Music part by TidalCycles
        * **Visual:** Video part by TouchDesigner
        * **Interaction:** Integration of sound and video, real-time nature
        * **Direction:** Timing, development, climax composition
    * **Preparation for Presentation (Day 5 PM - Day 6):**
        * Individual or group concept development
        * Prototype creation and testing
        * Rehearsal and refinement
        * Presentation and feedback
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Design and implement works integrating multiple technologies
        * Project management ability to complete works within limited time
        * Communication ability to present your own work to others
