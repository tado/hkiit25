# HKIIT Workshop Day 1 Morning (10:00 - 12:00)

## 1. Opening Session (10:00 - 10:40)

### 1-1. Introduction (10 min)

* **Welcome Address**
    * Thank you very much for joining the HKIIT Workshop today.
    * This workshop is a place to explore creative activities using cutting-edge digital technologies.
* **Instructor Introduction**
    * Instructor: Atsushi TADOKORO - Creative Coder, Live Coder, University Professor

### 1-2. Workshop Objectives (15 min)

This workshop aims to go beyond simply "using" digital technology, but to master it as a "tool for expression." Through six days of intensive learning, you will acquire practical skills to expand your creativity.

The specific objectives are the following four points:

* **1. Understanding Generative AI and Acquiring Creative Application Skills**
    * First, we will learn the fundamentals of Generative AI, which has become essential in modern creative environments.
    * You will understand the concepts behind core technologies like Transformers and LLMs and learn how they are applied to image, music, and code generation.
    * Going beyond mere tool introductions, we will explore how to view AI as a "source of ideas" or a "collaborator" and integrate it into your own creative process.

* **2. Mastering Music Construction Skills through Live Coding**
    * Using TidalCycles, you will thoroughly learn the technique of "live coding"—generating music in real-time using code—from the ground up.
    * You will experience a composition and performance method based on algorithmic thinking, different from traditional DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations).
    * You will develop the ability to express musical ideas through code, acquiring skills to improvise patterns and build complex rhythms.

* **3. Exploring Real-time Audiovisual Expression**
    * You will learn to operate TouchDesigner, a visual programming environment.
    * You will acquire techniques to generate interactive visuals in real-time.
    * In the latter half of the workshop, you will challenge yourself to create audiovisual works where sound and visuals are tightly linked by sending "sound" information (waveform, frequency, rhythm) generated in TidalCycles to TouchDesigner.

* **4. Integrating Techniques and Practicing Live Performance**
    * The final goal of this workshop is not to let the learned techniques remain fragmented knowledge.
    * You will integrate the elements of Generative AI, live coding, and audiovisuals to build your own original live performance.
    * Through the final day's presentation, you will practically cultivate the ability to turn ideas into form and the power to communicate them to others.

### 1-3. Workshop Overall Schedule (15 min)

* **Schedule Overview**
    * **Day 1 (Today):** Generative AI and the Future of Creation
    * **Day 2-3:** Live Coding with TidalCycles (Basic & Practical)
    * **Day 4-5:** TouchDesigner and Audiovisual Production
    * **Day 6 (Final Day):** Live Performance Showcase
* **Learning Approach**
    * Each session will proceed in a cycle of "Lecture," "Workshop," "Production Practice," and "Presentation."
    * We will emphasize acquiring practical skills, not just knowledge input.

## 2. Logistics and Environment Check (10:40 - 10:50)

* **Questions and Support**
    * Please feel free to ask questions anytime, whether during lectures or practice sessions.
    * Instructors and staff will circulate and provide support during production practice.
* **Breaks**
    * We will take appropriate breaks between sessions.
* **Application Check**
    * This is a check for the applications you were asked to install in advance.
    * **Recommended Apps to Install:**
        * Google Chrome
        * Visual Studio Code
        * TouchDesigner (*Requires user registration and a key)
        * SuperCollider
        * Git
    * *(Note) We will install TidalCycles together in the afternoon of Day 2.*

## 3. Icebreaker (10:50 - 11:50)

### 3-1. Objective

* To deepen mutual understanding among participants.
* To share expectations for the workshop and enhance the learning effect.

### 3-2. Self-Introductions (40 min)

* We will divide into small groups of 3-4 people.
* Please share the following information within your group (approx. 3-5 minutes per person):
    1.  **Name (or Nickname)**
    2.  **Affiliation or Current Activities (student, designer, engineer, artist, etc.)**
    3.  **Tools you often use or technologies you are interested in**
    4.  **(Optional) Favorite artists or works that have influenced you**

* *(Group work implementation)*

### 3-3. Sharing Expectations (20 min)

* After self-introductions, discuss the following points in your group:
    1.  **What you particularly want to learn in this workshop**
    2.  **What kind of work you would like to create on the final day (current ideas)**
* A representative from each group will present the "things to learn" and "expectations" discussed within the group to everyone.

## 4. Closing (11:50 - 12:00)

* **Morning Wrap-up**
    * Thank you for your participation. This afternoon, we will finally move into concrete creation.
* **Afternoon Session Preview**
    * **From 13:00 (Tentative):** Workshop 1: Generative AI and the Future of Creation
    * We will introduce a wide range, from the basics of Generative AI to case studies of its application in artistic works.
* **Lunch Break** (12:00 - 13:00)
