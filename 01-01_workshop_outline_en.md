        * Technology is not just a "tool" but a "medium" that opens up new ways of thinking and possibilities for expression
        * I hope that you will find your own unique language of expression through technology

### 1-2. Workshop Objectives (15 minutes)

This workshop aims not only to "use" digital technology but also to master it as a "tool for expression." Through 6 days of intensive learning, you will acquire practical skills to expand your creativity.

The specific objectives are the following four points:

* **1. Understanding Generative AI and Acquiring Creative Application Skills**
    * First, we will learn the fundamentals of generative AI, which has become essential in modern creative environments.
    * Understand the concepts of core technologies such as Transformers and LLMs, and learn how they are applied to image, music, and code generation.
    * Rather than just introducing tools, we will explore ways to perceive AI as a "source of ideas" or "co-creator" and incorporate it into your own creative process.
    * **Specific Learning Content:**
        * Fundamentals of prompt engineering - techniques to obtain desired outputs from AI
        * Principles and applications of image generation AI (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc.)
        * Idea development using text generation AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
        * Possibilities and limitations of music generation AI (Suno, Udio, etc.)
        * Critical consideration of the impact AI brings to the creative process
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Technically understand how generative AI works
        * Select and utilize appropriate AI tools for your projects
        * Build new creative styles through collaboration between AI and humans

* **2. Acquiring Music Construction Skills through Live Coding**
    * Using TidalCycles, we will thoroughly learn the technique of "live coding," which generates music in real-time using code, from the basics.
    * Experience composition and performance methods based on algorithmic thinking, which differ from traditional DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations).
    * Acquire skills to improvisationally rearrange patterns and construct complex rhythms, developing the ability to express musical thinking through code.
    * **Characteristics of Live Coding:**
        * Generate and modify music in real-time while writing code
        * Pattern-based composition methods allow complex polyrhythms to be expressed concisely
        * Balance of improvisation and reproducibility - the same code produces the same result
        * Collaborative development by the open-source community
    * **Learning Flow:**
        * **Day 2 Morning:** Basic TidalCycles syntax, understanding pattern notation
        * **Day 2 Afternoon:** Sample manipulation, effects processing, rhythm pattern construction
        * **Day 3 Morning:** Advanced pattern manipulation, introduction of randomness and probability
        * **Day 3 Afternoon:** Original music production, preparation for live performance
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Master basic TidalCycles syntax and freely write patterns
        * Think by connecting music theory and coding
        * Acquire foundational skills for improvisational live performance

* **3. Exploring Real-time Audiovisual Expression**
    * Learn to operate TouchDesigner, a visual programming environment.
    * Acquire techniques to generate interactive visuals in real-time.
    * In the latter half of the workshop, we will send "sound" information (waveforms, frequencies, rhythms) generated by TidalCycles to TouchDesigner, challenging the creation of audiovisual works where sound and visuals are tightly integrated.
    * **Characteristics of TouchDesigner:**
        * Node-based visual programming environment
        * Excellent real-time performance, ideal for live performances
        * Can handle 3D, 2D, audio, video, and data processing in an integrated manner
        * Wide range of applications including projection mapping, VJing, installations, etc.
    * **Learning Content:**
        * **Day 4 Morning:** Basic TouchDesigner operation, understanding nodes and networks
        * **Day 4 Afternoon:** Creating generative visuals, parameter manipulation
        * **Day 5 Morning:** Audio-reactive video production, OSC/MIDI communication
        * **Day 5 Afternoon:** Integration with TidalCycles, creating integrated AV works
    * **Significance of Audiovisual Integration:**
        * Synergistic effects through interaction of sound and visuals
        * Data-driven visual generation - musical information controls visual parameters
        * Creating immersion in live performances
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Master basic TouchDesigner operations and create simple visual works
        * Analyze audio signals and map them to visual parameters
        * Build integrated systems that link TidalCycles and TouchDesigner

* **4. Technology Integration and Live Performance Practice**
    * The ultimate goal of this workshop is not to let the learned technologies remain fragmented knowledge.
    * Integrate the elements of generative AI, live coding, and audiovisuals to build your own original live performance.
    * Through the final day's presentation, you will practically develop the ability to give form to ideas and the ability to communicate them to others.
    * **Importance of an Integrated Approach:**
        * Contemporary media art is interdisciplinary - fusion of music, video, programming, and design
        * Not only individual technical acquisition but also the "design ability" to combine them is necessary
        * Balance of technical implementation skills and artistic expression
    * **Components of Live Performance:**
        * **Concept:** Theme, message, what you want to express in the work
        * **Sound:** Musical part using TidalCycles
        * **Visual:** Video part using TouchDesigner
        * **Interaction:** Coordination of sound and visuals, real-time nature
        * **Direction:** Composition of timing, development, and climax
    * **Preparation for the Presentation (Day 5 Afternoon - Day 6):**
        * Concept planning individually or in groups
        * Prototype creation and testing
        * Rehearsal and refinement
        * Presentation and feedback
    * **Learning Goals:**
        * Design and implement works that integrate multiple technologies
        * Project management skills to complete works within a limited time
        * Communication skills to present your work to others
