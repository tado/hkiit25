## About this workshop

In this workshop, you will learn about practical live coding performance using the actual code from my past live coding performances.

I will introduce various techniques useful for live performance, such as extending TidalCycles' sound library, designing instruments with SuperCollider, and linking TidalCycles with other applications.

## Code for live performance with TidalCycles

### Code examples from past performances

The history of the code for the performances I have done so far is stored in the following Github repository. I will explain what I am doing while looking at the actual code.

- https://github.com/tado/TidalProjects

### Extending the sound samples

The following Github repository contains the TidalCycles sound library that I actually use. You will learn how to extend your own sound library.

### Instrument design with SuperCollider

The following Github repository contains the code for instruments I designed in SuperCollider to be used with TidalCycles. You will learn how to design your own instruments using SuperCollider.

#### Let's have fun designing the performance!
